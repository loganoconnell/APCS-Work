//Your task is to encapsulate this file - make attributes/fields private 
//and write stubs for public methods getSuit, getRank, and getPointValue to access 
//those attributes. Then write their method bodies.

//Write setters - methods setSuit, setRank, and setPointValue that assigns values accepted by the method.  
//Stubs first, then bodies.
