PROJECT TITLE: Creating a Card Class
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: to create a Card class
VERSION or DATE:
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS:
USER INSTRUCTIONS:

We will do this together but here's the order:

1. Create a class called 'Card2'.
2. Create private data 
    -suit
    -rank
    -point value
3. Create a default constructor (no parameters) that will assign values for the 2 of Clubs.
4. Create a constructor that creates a card of our choosing.  The particular card in decided in the main.
5. Write getters and setters.  getSuit() should return the suit of the card and is therefore a return method.
                               setSuit() should set the card suit and is therefore a void method.
                               
6. Create a CardRunner class with a main().  Instantiate a few cards and using the default and parameter constructors.
       Access their data with appropriate methods.
       
7. (If time) write a toString() method that will nicely display a card's data.
